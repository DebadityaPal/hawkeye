# HawkEye

With the increase of surveillance cameras in modern cities, there are insufficient human resource for monitoring all the screens at one time. In our project, we use machine learning techniques to detect violent behavior so that it can give a quick alarm in time. 

The ML Model was trained on [RWF2000 Dataset](https://github.com/mchengny/RWF2000-Video-Database-for-Violence-Detection) which is a collection of nearly 2000 vedio clips as a new data set for real-world violent behavior detection under surveillance camera. 

### There are two parts of of this project 

1) The implementation of system code in Python (in the `SystemCode` directory)
2) The implementation of an Flutter App (in the `Flutter App` directory)
